Dating websites (and pretty much everything nowadays) are all superficial. My goal is to create a site that focuses on getting to know someone right from the start. The images of the users are blurred in the beginning so people get to know the users based off the how they answered their questions. If they are interested in the person they will click or swipe to like and attempt to match. If the users match, they will then be allowed to see a non-blurred image of the person they matched with.
